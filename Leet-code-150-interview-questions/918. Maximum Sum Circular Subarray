# Intuition
* currmax stores the max of ( currmax + the present number , the number itself is greter then max till now)
* similarly curr min stores the minimum at present 
* whereas the global max stores the overall max till now that we get 
* and global min contains the overall min value that we get
* the total calculate the sum of all the values
* now why we have this is bcus our answer is either the global max that we got or the the total - global minimum (this means sum of all except the global minimum which gives us a max sum that we could get from a circular list)
* now in the last we put that condition bcus if [-5,-3,-5] a list with all negative value comes then our globalmax which is set to nums[0] and the total-globalmin would give us wrong answer
* so at that time globalmax will be our right answer

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def maxSubarraySumCircular(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        globalmax, globalmin = nums[0], nums[0]
        currmax, currmin = 0, 0
        total = 0

        for n in nums:
            currmax = max(currmax + n, n)
            currmin = min(currmin + n, n)

            globalmax = max(globalmax, currmax)
            globalmin = min(globalmin, currmin)
            
            total += n
        
        return max(globalmax, total-globalmin) if globalmax>0 else globalmax
