* a list represent a,b,c occurrence
* the full meaning of this code is that first we travel the string till we have atleast one occurence of all a,b,c>1 
* and then we move our left pointer and each time while moving it we check it also have a,b,c>1 if so then again we add to our answer
* the above our main important point
* while instead of going through each substring as the question says atleast one occurence so the string with a,b,c>1 + rest also gives us a substring len(s)-right 
* :)

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def numberOfSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        li = [0,0,0]

        left = 0
        right = 0
        ans = 0

        while(right<len(s)):
            li[ord(s[right]) - ord('a')] +=1

            while(li[0]>0 and li[1]>0 and li[2]>0):
                ans += len(s)-right
                li[ord(s[left]) - ord('a')] -=1
                left +=1
            
            right +=1
        
        return ans
