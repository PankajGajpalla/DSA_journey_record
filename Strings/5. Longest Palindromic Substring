# Intuition
* the whole idea is selecting each char from the string and then 
* take a left and right pointer check if they are same and keep doing it if its same and get the highest
* there are 2 case odd like  cbabc and even cbbc

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        ans = ""
        anslen = 0

        for i in range(len(s)):
            
            # odd center
            l,r = i,i

            while l>=0 and r<len(s) and s[l]==s[r]:
                if (r-l+1)>anslen:
                    ans = s[l:r+1]
                    anslen = r-l+1
                l -=1
                r +=1
            
            # even center
            l,r = i, i+1
