            #temp.pop(), nothing like that is needed as it here temp is an integer which is passed by value we dont need to backtrack it 
            
            #In Python:
            # Integers are passed by value (immutable)
            # Lists are passed by reference (mutable)

            #Key observation 🧠
            # temp is an integer, so no .copy() is needed
            # Each recursive call gets its own value
            # This is why the code works without backtracking temp

        solve(0, 0)
        return result
