# Intuition
4️⃣ Without memo (problem)
s = "catsanddog"
dict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]

solve(0)
 ├─ "cat" → solve(3)
 │    ├─ "sand" → solve(7)
 │    │    ├─ "dog" → solve(10) ✅
 │
 ├─ "cats" → solve(4)
      ├─ "and" → solve(7)   ← REPEATED CALL

🚨 solve(7) is called TWICE

For longer strings, this becomes thousands of repeats → TLE

5️⃣ With memo (what changes)
solve(7) → True
memo[7] = True

# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
           
        n = len(s)
        wordSet = set(wordDict)   # Faster lookup
        memo = {}                 # Memoization dictionary

        def solve(i):
            # Base case: reached end of string
            if i == n:
                return True

            # If already computed
            if i in memo:
                return memo[i]

            # Try all possible splits
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                if s[i:j] in wordSet and solve(j):
                    memo[i] = True
                    return True

            memo[i] = False
            return False

        return solve(0)
        
```
