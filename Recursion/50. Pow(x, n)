# Intuition
* when n is even then we square the number x and half the power n
* lets say we have 2^6 so we can write this as 4^3 thats what we do and make the recursive depth even lesser
* And for odd value of n we do it simply x* call it again then it will become even :)


# Code
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def myPow(self, x: float, n: int) -> float:
        if n==0:
            return 1
        if n<0:
            return 1/self.myPow(x, -n)
        
        # even
        if n%2==0:
            return self.myPow(x*x, n//2) #this is genius
        else:
            return x * self.myPow(x, n-1)
```
